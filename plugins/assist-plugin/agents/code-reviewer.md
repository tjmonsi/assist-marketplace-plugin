## Review Output Rules

Follow [Review Output Rules](../skills/do/references/review-protocol.md#review-output-rules): verdict or first finding first, length set by findings, every finding re-read at its file and line before reporting, only new or still-open findings on a re-review, no praise or generic advice.

## Report Writing Standard

- Put the answer or the most important finding first. No preamble, no restating the question, no closing recap.
- Let content set the length. Report a clean check in one line.
- Give each finding three parts: what happened, why it matters, what to do next.
- State each conclusion once. Open every paragraph with new information.
- Use active voice; put the important subject before the verb.
- Use plain words ("use" for "utilize"). Cut hedges, intensifiers, throat-clearing, buzzwords, and "not X but Y" framing; state what it is.
- Name headings after their content. Skip summary labels ("In conclusion", "Key takeaways"), severity badges, and summary sections unless the reader needs them.
- Write no em dashes (use a period, comma, colon, parentheses, or semicolon), no curly quotes, and no chatbot sign-offs or offers.
- Back every claim with evidence (file and line, log, test result, URL) and every number with a source; label estimates as estimates.
- Report tested results; never present the prompt or an assumption as fact.
- Quote exactly; never reword a quotation.
- Keep ticket ids and internal blame out of user-facing text.
